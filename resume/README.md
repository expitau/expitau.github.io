# Resume

## Data
All content of the resume is in src/data.yaml

## Build
The resume can be automatically printed to html and pdf by running build.cjs. This requires puppeteer. If this doesn't work, right click save as the html file, and print to pdf.

After build, run modifypdf.cjs to create a searchable text pdf.
